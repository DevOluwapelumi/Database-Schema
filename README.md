# Database-Schema

Designing a database schema for an online merch store involves defining the structure of the database to efficiently store and manage information related to products, customers, orders, and other relevant entities. Below is a simplified example of a database schema for an online merch store:

Entities and their attributes:

Customers:

customer_id (Primary Key)
first_name
last_name
email
phone_number
address
...
Products:

product_id (Primary Key)
name
description
price
stock_quantity
category_id (Foreign Key referencing Categories)
...
Categories:

category_id (Primary Key)
name
description
...
Orders:

order_id (Primary Key)
customer_id (Foreign Key referencing Customers)
order_date
total_amount
...
Order_Items:

order_item_id (Primary Key)
order_id (Foreign Key referencing Orders)
product_id (Foreign Key referencing Products)
quantity
subtotal
...
Payment_Methods:

payment_method_id (Primary Key)
customer_id (Foreign Key referencing Customers)
method_type (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal, etc.)
details (e.g., Credit Card number, PayPal email, etc.)
...
This schema provides a basic structure for an online merch store. It can be further enhanced with additional features, such as user authentication, reviews and ratings, wishlists, discounts, shipping information, and more, depending on the specific requirements of the store.

It's important to note that this is a simplified schema, and in a real-world scenario, you might need to consider more aspects, such as data normalization, indexing, and optimization for better performance. Additionally, the choice of database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) will also impact the actual implementation of this schema.
